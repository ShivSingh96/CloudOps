# **Optimizing Docker Images with Dive**  

## **March 23, 2025**  

### **Introduction**  
🎬 *[Background music fades in]*  

🗣️ *"Are your Docker images bloated? Do you want to analyze and optimize them effortlessly? Meet Dive – a powerful tool to inspect, explore, and reduce the size of your Docker images!"*  

👨‍💻 *"In this blog, we’ll break down Dive, see how it works, and learn how to integrate it into your development workflow!"*  

📌 *"By the end, you’ll be able to optimize your Docker images like a pro!"*  

---

## **1️⃣ What is Dive?**  

📢 *"Dive is an open-source tool that lets you explore your Docker images layer by layer. It helps you identify unnecessary files, duplicated content, and inefficiencies in your images."*  

### **Key Benefits:**  
✅ Visualize Docker image layers  
✅ Detect unnecessary files and inefficiencies  
✅ Get an efficiency score to optimize your images  
✅ Integrate it with CI/CD pipelines to prevent bloated images

## **2️⃣ Installing Dive**  

🛠️ *"Now, let’s get Dive installed!"*  

### **🔹 For Ubuntu/Debian:**  
```sh
DIVE_VERSION=$(curl -sL "https://api.github.com/repos/wagoodman/dive/releases/latest" | grep '"tag_name":' | sed -E 's/.*"v([^"]+)".*/\1/')
curl -fOL "https://github.com/wagoodman/dive/releases/download/v${DIVE_VERSION}/dive_${DIVE_VERSION}_linux_amd64.deb"
sudo apt install ./dive_${DIVE_VERSION}_linux_amd64.deb
```  

### **🔹 For macOS (Homebrew):**  
```sh
brew install wagoodman/dive/dive
```  

### **🔹 For Windows (Chocolatey):**  
```sh
choco install dive
```  

### **🔹 Using Docker (No Installation Needed!):**  
```sh
docker run --rm -it -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock ghcr.io/wagoodman/dive:latest
```  

🛠️ *"With Dive installed, let’s explore a Docker image!"*

## **3️⃣ Exploring a Docker Image**  

🔍 *"You can analyze any Docker image with a single command:"*  
```sh
dive <image_name>
```  

💡 **Example:**  
```sh
dive nginx:latest
```  

🎥 *[Screen Recording: Running the command and showcasing the UI]*  

🖥️ *"On the left, we see the layers of our Docker image. On the right, we see the file structure. This helps us understand what changes occur in each layer."*  

### **👀 Key Insights:**  
📌 Files added, modified, or deleted in each layer  
📌 Efficiency score (how much space is wasted)  
📌 Navigating with arrow keys to explore files

## **4️⃣ Optimizing Your Docker Images**  

🛠️ **Common Optimization Tips:**  
🚀 **1. Reduce the Number of Layers** (Use multi-stage builds)  
🚀 **2. Avoid Unnecessary Files** (Ignore cache, logs, and temp files)  
🚀 **3. Minimize Duplicate Files** (Avoid copying files multiple times)  
🚀 **4. Use Efficient Base Images** (*Alpine is lightweight!*)  

### **📌 Example - Before Optimization:**  
```dockerfile
FROM ubuntu:latest
COPY . /app
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y curl
RUN rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*
```  

### **📌 Example - After Optimization (Better Layering & Cleanup):**  
```dockerfile
FROM ubuntu:latest
COPY . /app
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y curl \
    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*
```  

📉 *"By structuring our layers properly, we can shrink our image size significantly!"*  

---

## **5️⃣ CI/CD Integration**  

🔗 *"Want to enforce efficiency checks in your pipeline?"*  
💡 *"Dive can be used in CI to prevent bloated images!"*  

### **🔹 CI Mode (Skips UI, Returns Pass/Fail):**  
```sh
CI=true dive <image_name>
```  

### **🔹 Define Rules in `.dive-ci`:**  
```yaml
rules:
  lowestEfficiency: 0.95
  highestWastedBytes: 20MB
  highestUserWastedPercent: 0.20
```  

✅ *"If the efficiency is below 95% or wasted space is over 20MB, the pipeline will fail – keeping our images lean!"*  

---

## **6️⃣ Wrapping Up**  

🎯 *"And that’s how you can explore and optimize Docker images with Dive!"*  

📌 **Key Takeaways:**  
✅ Visualize Docker image layers  
✅ Identify wasted space  
✅ Optimize images for better performance  
✅ Automate efficiency checks in CI/CD
