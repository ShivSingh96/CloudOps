I have been quietly preparing for the Certified Kubernetes Administrator (CKA) exam over the last few weeks. Here is a simple roadmap that keeps me on track.

1️⃣ Start with Linux basics — commands, networking, and permissions are the foundation.
 2️⃣ Learn Kubernetes fundamentals — Pods, Deployments, Services, ConfigMaps, Secrets.
 3️⃣ Practice daily on a cluster — Minikube or kind works great. Break things, fix them, repeat.
 4️⃣ Dive into advanced concepts — RBAC, Network Policies, Storage, StatefulSets.
 5️⃣ Sharpen troubleshooting skills — debugging nodes, pods, and services under time pressure.
 6️⃣ Use the CNCF syllabus as a checklist — it’s the best way to stay focused.
 7️⃣ Simulate the real exam — Killer.sh and KillerKoda mock tests are a must.
 8️⃣ Manage your time wisely — 2 hours, ~15–20 questions, kubectl shortcuts are lifesavers.

⚡ My takeaway so far: Don’t just study for the exam. Learn to think like an admin managing real clusters. Once that mindset clicks, CKA becomes much easier.
